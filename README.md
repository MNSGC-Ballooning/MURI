# MURI
Project MURI is an intiative using high altitude ballooning to measure the temprature, pressure, and particulate matter concentration
of the stratosphere. This data will help researchers determine the most important factor in the cause of turbulence that hypersonic 
vehicles experience when flying in the stratosphere. The MNSGC Ballooning Team's main focus will be collecting data on particulate 
matter concentrations in the stratosphere. This will be done through the use of optical dust sensors. In order to collect accurate data,
the thermal wake of the balloon and its velocity have to be minimized. One approach to minimize these problems is to make the balloon hover or
descend very slowly. The current plans to acheive this are through a mechanical venting system or through a cut away system that uses 
multiple balloons.
